I'll guide you through setting up the most cost-effective solution using the hybrid approach (Google Colab Pro + Lambda Labs). This approach will keep costs under $500 while giving you the flexibility to scale when needed.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

### Phase 1: Initial Development with Google Colab Pro
1. **Setup Google Colab Pro**
   - Cost: $10/month
   - Steps:
     1. Go to [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup)
     2. Subscribe to Colab Pro
     3. Create a new notebook
     4. Enable GPU runtime (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)

2. **Initial Environment Setup**
   ```python
   # In your Colab notebook
   !git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-clone-avatar.git
   %cd ai-clone-avatar
   
   # Install dependencies
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Verify GPU access
   !nvidia-smi
   ```

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Use Colab for:
     - Code development
     - Small model tests
     - Data preprocessing
     - Initial training runs
   - Save checkpoints to Google Drive
   - Use version control (Git) for code management

### Phase 2: Serious Training with Lambda Labs
1. **Setup Lambda Labs Account**
   - Cost: $0.60/hour (only pay when using)
   - Steps:
     1. Go to [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/)
     2. Create an account
     3. Add payment method
     4. Select RTX 3090 instance (24GB VRAM)

2. **Environment Setup on Lambda**
   ```bash
   # SSH into your instance
   ssh ubuntu@<your-instance-ip>
   
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-clone-avatar.git
   cd ai-clone-avatar
   
   # Setup Python environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Setup data directory
   mkdir -p data/checkpoints
   ```

3. **Training Workflow**
   - Use Lambda for:
     - Full model training
     - Long-running experiments
     - Production model training
   - Implement checkpointing
   - Use screen or tmux for long-running sessions

### Cost Optimization Tips:

1. **Google Colab Pro Usage**:
   - Use for development and testing only
   - Keep sessions under 12 hours
   - Save work frequently
   - Estimated cost: $10/month

2. **Lambda Labs Usage**:
   - Start instance only when training
   - Use spot instances if available
   - Shut down when not in use
   - Estimated cost: ~$100-200 for 200-300 hours of training

3. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Use Google Drive for development (free)
   - Use Lambda's included storage for training
   - Backup important checkpoints to Google Drive

### Total Estimated Costs:
- Google Colab Pro: $10/month
- Lambda Labs: ~$100-200 (for 200-300 hours of training)
- Total: ~$110-210 for first month

### Monitoring and Management:

1. **Resource Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # On Lambda instance
   watch -n 1 nvidia-smi  # Monitor GPU usage
   htop  # Monitor CPU and memory
   ```

2. **Training Progress**:
   - Use TensorBoard for monitoring
   - Save logs and metrics
   - Implement early stopping

3. **Cost Tracking**:
   - Monitor Lambda Labs usage dashboard
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Track training hours
