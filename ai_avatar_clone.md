**User**

@Web is there any open source AI that can clone a person by using video footage?

---

**Cursor**

Based on current information, there are very few truly open-source AI projects that allow you to create a full "AI clone" of a person using video footage (i.e., generating a talking avatar that mimics a specific person's appearance, voice, and mannerisms). Most of the leading solutions in this space—such as Argil, CreatorKit, HeyGen, and Synthesia—are commercial platforms and do not provide open-source code for their core technology.

However, there are some open-source projects and research that can be used to build similar capabilities, though they often require significant technical expertise to set up and use. Here are a few notable options:

### 1. Wav2Lip
- **Description:** Wav2Lip is an open-source project that achieves state-of-the-art lip-syncing of a video of a person speaking to any audio track.
- **What it does:** You provide a video of a person and an audio file, and it generates a new video where the person's lips are synced to the audio.
- **Limitations:** It does not generate new facial expressions or body movements, and it does not clone the voice—just the lip movements.
- **Repo:** [Wav2Lip GitHub](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip)

### 2. SadTalker
- **Description:** SadTalker is an open-source project that generates talking head videos from a single image and an audio file.
- **What it does:** You can create a talking video from just a photo and an audio track, with some facial expression and head movement synthesis.
- **Limitations:** It does not use full video footage for training, and the realism is not as high as commercial products.
- **Repo:** [SadTalker GitHub](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker)

### 3. Avatarify
- **Description:** Avatarify is an open-source tool that allows you to animate a target face (from a photo) in real time using your own facial movements via webcam.
- **What it does:** Real-time face reenactment, often used for video calls.
- **Limitations:** Not designed for training on video footage to create a persistent "clone," but can be adapted for some use cases.
- **Repo:** [Avatarify GitHub](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify)

### 4. First Order Motion Model
- **Description:** This is a research project that animates a target image using the motion of a source video.
- **What it does:** You can animate a still image using the motion from another video.
- **Limitations:** Not a full "clone" solution, but a building block for such systems.
- **Repo:** [First Order Motion Model GitHub](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model)

---

### Summary
- There is no fully open-source, plug-and-play solution that matches the capabilities of commercial AI clone platforms like Argil or CreatorKit.
- Open-source projects like Wav2Lip, SadTalker, Avatarify, and First Order Motion Model can be combined to create basic AI-driven talking avatars, but require technical setup and do not offer the same level of realism or ease of use.
- For a full-featured, high-quality AI clone, commercial platforms are currently the best option, but they are not open source.

What if I want to build my own what do I need to do? Do I write in Python do I use Tessa flow?

---

**Cursor**

If you want to build your own AI system to "clone" a person using video footage, here’s a practical roadmap and the technologies you’ll likely use:

---

## 1. **Programming Language**
- **Python** is the standard for AI/ML research and prototyping. Most open-source projects and deep learning frameworks are Python-based.

---

## 2. **Core Components**
To build a convincing AI clone, you’ll need to address several subproblems:

### a. **Face and Head Animation**
- **Goal:** Animate a face (and possibly upper body) to match speech and expressions.
- **Open-source options:**  
  - [SadTalker](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker) (image-to-talking-head)
  - [First Order Motion Model](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model) (image animation)
  - [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) (lip sync only)
- **Custom model:** You can train your own using deep learning libraries (see below).

### b. **Voice Cloning (optional)**
- **Goal:** Synthesize speech in the target person’s voice.
- **Open-source options:**  
  - [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)
  - [Resemble AI](https://www.resemble.ai/) (commercial, but has open-source elements)
  - [YourTTS](https://github.com/Edresson/YourTTS)
- **Data:** You’ll need clean audio samples of the person.

### c. **Video Synthesis Pipeline**
- **Goal:** Combine the animated face/head with the generated or real audio.
- **Tools:** Python scripts, ffmpeg for video processing, and deep learning models for animation.

---

## 3. **Frameworks and Libraries**
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: Most modern deep learning models are built with these. PyTorch is more popular for research and prototyping.
- **OpenCV**: For video/image processing.
- **ffmpeg**: For video/audio manipulation (not Python, but can be called from Python).
- **Dlib/face_recognition**: For face detection and alignment.

---

## 4. **Workflow Example**
1. **Collect Data:** Gather video and audio of the person you want to clone.
2. **Preprocess Data:** Extract frames, align faces, clean audio.
3. **Train/Use Models:**
   - Use or fine-tune a talking head model (e.g., SadTalker).
   - Use or fine-tune a TTS/voice cloning model (e.g., Coqui TTS).
4. **Synthesize Output:**
   - Generate audio from text (if using TTS).
   - Animate the face using the video model and the audio.
   - Merge audio and video using ffmpeg.
5. **Post-process:** Clean up artifacts, adjust timing, etc.

---

## 5. **What about Tessa Flow?**
- **Tessa Flow** does not appear to be a known framework in the AI/ML or video synthesis space. You probably mean **TensorFlow**, which is a major deep learning framework (like PyTorch).
- **TensorFlow** is a good choice, but most recent research and open-source projects in this area use **PyTorch**.

---

## 6. **Hardware**
- **GPU**: Training and running these models is much faster on a modern NVIDIA GPU (CUDA support).
- **RAM/Storage**: Video and model files can be large.

---

## 7. **References & Starting Points**
- [SadTalker GitHub](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker)
- [Wav2Lip GitHub](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip)
- [First Order Motion Model GitHub](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model)
- [Coqui TTS GitHub](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)
- [YourTTS GitHub](https://github.com/Edresson/YourTTS)

## 8. **Summary Table**

| Task                | Library/Model         | Language | Notes                        |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------|------------------------------|
| Face Animation      | SadTalker, FOMM      | Python   | PyTorch-based                |
| Lip Sync            | Wav2Lip              | Python   | PyTorch-based                |
| Voice Cloning       | Coqui TTS, YourTTS   | Python   | PyTorch/TensorFlow           |
| Video Processing    | ffmpeg, OpenCV       | Python   | ffmpeg is CLI, OpenCV is lib |
| Deep Learning       | PyTorch, TensorFlow  | Python   | PyTorch preferred            |

---

**In summary:**  
- Use Python and PyTorch for most of your work.
- Start by experimenting with SadTalker and Wav2Lip for video, and Coqui TTS for voice.
- You’ll need to script the pipeline to combine these components.

**User**

let's do the rest

It is installing multiple versions of TTS. is it necessary?

---

**Cursor**

No, it is **not necessary** to install multiple versions of the `TTS` package. You only need one version—preferably the latest stable release—unless you have a specific compatibility requirement with another tool or library.

### Why might this happen?
- If you run `pip install` multiple times with different version constraints, or if other packages require different versions, pip may attempt to resolve dependencies in a way that appears to install multiple versions.
- Sometimes, pip will download and build wheels for different versions during dependency resolution, but only one version will be installed in your environment.

### What should you do?
- **Stick to one version**: The latest version of [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) is usually best unless you have a reason to use an older one.
- **Check your `requirements.txt`**: Make sure it only lists `TTS` once, and optionally specify a version (e.g., `TTS==0.22.0`).
- **Check for conflicts**: If you see errors or warnings about version conflicts, you may need to adjust your dependencies.

### How to check what’s installed
After installation, you can check the installed version with:
```bash
pip show TTS
```

---

**Summary:**  
You only need one version of `TTS`. If you see multiple versions being downloaded, it’s likely part of pip’s dependency resolution process, but only one will be installed. If you want to be sure, specify a version in your `requirements.txt` and check the installed version after setup.

Let me know if you want to pin a specific version or need help resolving dependency issues!

```shellscript
pip show TTS
```
